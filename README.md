***Banking Management System***

## Overview

The **Banking Management System** is a console-based Java application that allows users to register, login, manage their bank accounts, and perform banking operations like debit, credit, transfer, and balance inquiries. It uses MySQL as the backend database to store user and account details.

## Features

- **User Registration:** Users can create an account by providing basic information.
- **User Login:** Existing users can log in to access their bank accounts.
- **Open Bank Account:** Once logged in, users can open a new bank account.
- **Debit Money:** Users can withdraw funds from their account.
- **Credit Money:** Users can deposit funds into their account.
- **Transfer Money:** Transfer funds between accounts.
- **Check Balance:** Users can check their current account balance.
- **Secure:** The application uses email-based authentication for login.

## Technologies Used

- **Java:** Core language for building the application.
- **JDBC:** Used to connect the application to the MySQL database.
- **MySQL:** Backend database for storing user and account information.
- **Scanner:** For input handling.

## Requirements

- **Java 8 or higher**
- **MySQL Database**
- **MySQL JDBC Driver** (`com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver`)

## Database Setup

1. Install MySQL on your system.
2. Create a database named `Banking_System`.
3. Create the necessary tables for users, accounts, and transactions.

Hereâ€™s a sample table schema for users:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE Banking_System;

USE Banking_System;

CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE accounts (
    account_number BIGINT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    balance DECIMAL(10, 2) DEFAULT 0,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_email) REFERENCES users(email)
);
```

## Installation and Running the Application

1. Clone this repository or download the source code.
2. Make sure you have Java and MySQL installed on your system.
3. Update the database connection credentials in the `BankingApp.java` file:
   ```java
   private static final String url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/Banking_System";
   private static final String username = "root";
   private static final String password = "your_mysql_password";
   ```
4. Compile and run the Java application using your preferred IDE or from the command line:
   ```bash
   javac BankingApp.java
   java BankingApp
   ```

## Usage

- **Register:** Create a new user account by selecting the "Register" option.
- **Login:** Use your registered email and password to log in.
- **Bank Operations:**
  - Open a new bank account after logging in.
  - Perform transactions like debit, credit, transfer, or check balance.

## Future Improvements

- Add encryption for storing passwords securely.
- Implement more robust error handling and input validation.
- Add support for multiple accounts under a single user.
